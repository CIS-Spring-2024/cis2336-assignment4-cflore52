<p> Camila Flores is the proud owner of the Study Cafe. With over 10 years of experience in management, Camila wanted to open a Cafeteria on the UH Sugar Land Campus, that would allow students to use their Cougar Cash and Shasta Bucks.  </p>
<br>
<p> Camila came across the idea of opening a Cafeteria on the Sugar Land campus, when she realized she was spending a lot of time trying to find places to eat around campus. Not only was it time consuming, but also expensive. Camila decided that opening a cafeteria with various lunch options would be convenient to the students, and the school, as it would provide another source of income.</p>
<br>
<p> In addition to opening the Study Cafe and managing it, Camila, an 18 year old, is a current UH Computer Information Systems student and is set to graduate May of 2025. She has an internship at a non-profit, that has taught her much of what she knows about business management now.  </p>
<br>
<p> When she is not at school, work, or managing the Study Cafe, Camila enjoys running, hiking, reading, and shopping. </p>
